A website the Daily Bruin uses to keep track of all of our sources.
It's powered by an Express server with a PostgreSQL backend and a GraphQL
endpoint, and uses React on the frontend.

The production version is only available to Daily Bruin members.

## Technologies Used

Below is a non-exhaustive list of some of the more major technologies used by Sources and the reasoning why these technologies were chosen. This list is meant to give you a starting point for considering adding or changing the technologies used by Sources or other projects and should change over time as needs and technologies change.

### General

* [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) is a language developed by Microsoft. It's like JavaScript with types!
* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) is testing framework.
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io) is an code formatter that makes sure all our code looks pretty!

### Frontend

* [React](https://reactjs.org) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) is an application bundler focused on simplicity and speed. It's very new and currently has a lot of bugs and limitations but shows a lot of promise and is much easier to use than alternatives such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org).
* [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/client) is a popular GraphQL client that works very nicely with React.
* [react-table](https://react-table.js.org) is a small and extensible component for displaying data (in our case, all of the Sources). It was selected because it's popular and had all the features we need. A potential alternative that was considered was [react-data-grid](http://adazzle.github.io/react-data-grid/), but we liked the lightweightness and styling of react-table better.
* [react-contextmenu](https://vkbansal.me/react-contextmenu/) is a simple popup context menu used to display options to edit and delete sources. We actually started by using [react-contextify](https://github.com/galkinrost/react-contextify), but switched to react-contextmenu as it was more popular and appeared to be more actively developed.
* [react-modal](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal) is a simple modal component used to display the "Add" and "Edit" modals. A couple of modal components were considered, but react-modal seemed to be the least opinionated and did not come bundled as part of a larger library, such as [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io).

### Backend

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) almost needs no introduction. A JavaScript runtime for servers.
* [Express](https://expressjs.com) is the most popular web framework for Node.
* [Google APIs Node.js Client](http://google.github.io/google-api-nodejs-client/22.2.0/index.html) are used to authenticated users via Google Oauth 2.
* [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/servers) is a popular serverside package for creating a server that supports GraphQL queries.
* [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com) is an ORM (Object-Relation Mapping) library for SQL in JavaScript. Essentially, it allows us to represent our database in JavaScript. Pretty nifty!

## Services Used

In addition to the technologies used about, Sources has a few services integrated with the repository to make maintenance and development easier. They are:

* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/dailybruin/sources) for continuous integration.
* [CodeCov](https://codecov.io/gh/dailybruin/sources) for code coverage visualization.
* [dependencies.io](https://app.dependencies.io/projects/github/daily-bruin/sources) for dependency management and automatic updates.
* [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/daily-bruin/sources) for code analysis.

Sources follows an [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller)
pattern.

The models are defined through Sequelize and stored in the `models` folder,
along with some general database configuration. Currently there's only one
model, Source.

Controllers are stored in the `controllers` folder. There are 2 controllers,
`authController` and `sourceController` that take care of Google Oauth
authentication and interfacing with the Source model respectively.

Frontend files are stored in the `views` folder. This includes both the login and main pages (`login.html` and `index.html` respectively) as well as React components (in the `components/` directory).

Note that test files are put in the same directory as the respective file they test and have the extension `.test.ts`.

## Contributing to Sources

### Prerequisites

There are a couple of programs and files Sources depends on that you'll need to
have installed to run it locally.

1. Node – You can install this with a simple `brew install node` on macOS.
2. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) – Yarn is a JavaScript
   package manager, and an alternative to npm. We prefer it to npm because it
   has a couple of nice features such as caching, lockfiles, and faster
   downloads.
3. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) – VS Code is an open
   source text editor built by Microsoft and has amazing tooling support for
   TypeScript projects (as well as a lot of other awesome features!). You can
   use any text editor you want, but VS Code will give you a nice experience :).
4. PostgreSQL – Postgres is the database we use. Installing it locally can be a
   little daunting, so check out our guide below if you're unfamiliar with it!
5. A `.env` file – It's [good practice](https://12factor.net/config) to store
   things like API keys and database information with environment variables so
   that they can easily be changed for different environments without code
   changes. This is cool, but when you have a lot of configuration variables it
   can become hard to manage, so we use a package called
   [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) that reads configuration data
   from a file called `.env` and puts them into `process.env`. Check out our
   guide below for an example `.env`.

#### Installing PostgreSQL

##### Mac

You want to install Postgres through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

```shell
brew install postgres
```

Then start Postgres with the command:

```shell
brew services start postgresql
```

Awesome! For reference, you can stop postgres at any time with `berw services stop postgresql`. You don't want to do that right now, though! Instead, you'll want to create Sources' database. We call ours `sources`.

```shell
createdb sources
```

You'll also want to create a dummy database used for testing. It's called `sources-test`.

```shell
createdb sources
```

Note that by default, the Postgres user is your computer's username and there is
no password. When creating your `.env` file, the values will look something like:

```
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_USER=nathan
DATABASE_PASSWORD=
...
(other values)
...
```

Dope. Now you'll want to just create some data with `yarn create-data` and you're ready to go!

For development, you may also find it useful to use a GUI client to visualize the database. There [a lot of great options](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Community_Guide_to_PostgreSQL_GUI_Tools), but we recommend [PSequel](http://www.psequel.com)!

##### Windows

We're working on this! If you know how to install Postgres on Windows, please
make a pull request!

#### Example .env File

If you're making your own, the values you'll want are:

```
DATABASE_HOST=
DATABASE_USER=
DATABASE_PASSWORD=
G_CLIENT_ID=
G_CLIENT_SECRET=
```
